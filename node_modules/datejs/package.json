  "readme": "DateJS is not working in 0.4.x - I'm now investigating it.\n==========================================================\n\nDateJS\n------\n\nThis is a simple NPM wrapper around the excellent datejs client-side library.\n\nIt modifies the Date prototype - this technique is looked down upon, but it's\na very useful library.\n\nSee [the datejs site](http://www.datejs.com/) for more information.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nIn the shell:\n\n    npm install datejs\n\nIn your app:\n\n    require('datejs');\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nNPM package datejs v0.0.1 corresponds to datejs Alpha1.  It hasn't changed for \nthree years, so hopefully it won't be too much of a maintenance nightmare.\n\nI've just included all of the non-US locales in lib - I've not written any way \nto access them yet.\n\nWhat I'll probably do is create a wrapper which defaults to en-US, but can be\ncalled with other locales.\n\nI am not the author of datejs.  I'm just maintaining an NPM package of it, as I\nneeded one.\n",
